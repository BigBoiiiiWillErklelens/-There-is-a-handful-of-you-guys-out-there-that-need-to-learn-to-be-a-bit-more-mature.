Software instructions (there are syntax errors but previous versions of the code worked fine)
	1. Read options
	2. Each option has a number next to it (like a vending machine)
	3. Type the number of the option you want
	4. If you did not follow the instructions and messed up, The program will give you a 
		whoopsie and you can try again.
	5. For example, if you want to add an interger to the list, select the add interger option, then follow further instroctions.
Don't understand enough for question 2

The change I tried to make to  the program was a download fuction. After you make your list, what are you 
supposed to do with it? Stand there and look at it? NAH. YOU GOTTA BE ABLE TO EXPORT IT.
SO I tried to ADD a FUNCTION to my cOdE ThAt wOulD allow me to downloadloadloadload the final list.
DIDN'T WORK!

10. Download Code

def downloadCode():
        f.write("Now the file has more content!")
    f.close()

    
    f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
    print(f.read())
